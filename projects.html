            <div class="writing">

                We learned about the game engine and understood the basic simulation methodology, and now We can run the simulation at our disposal.
                Unity has many AI-based technologies like Reinforcement learning, so you can do many fun projects.
                Fall Guys, which was once very famous game, was also made by using Unity. Want to develops games or simulations that don't require high performance computer and have cute characters?

            <div class="writing">
                Vissim is a tool optimized for automobile-related simulation among various simulation tools.
                Vissim can design custom road environments more comfortably than other tools and summon cars to custom roads at will.
                In addition, there are many functions related to the simulation of the vehicle, such as analyzing the flow of the vehicle and outputting it as Excel data.
                Using a Vissim, we built a Technopolis road and ran a vehicle flow simulation on it.
                This project can contribute to many things, such as simulation of autonomous vehicles targeting Technopolis in the future.

                About 30 pages of this project report that We wrote ourself are kept in the lab material. This project use not only object detecting but object tracking using byte tracker.

            <strong>5. Creating a Drone that follows and attacks certain object we want.</strong>
            <div class="writing">
                When We worked on the project with the RC car, We could only follow the object at a slow speed due to the hardware's response speed limit. 
                However, by using the Telo Edu drone with strong hardware, it is possible to follow the desired object well at high speed. 
                In this process, control algorithms such as PID control were used, and the concept of signal was also used to freely change modes such as keyboard mode, tracking mode, and attacking mode.
                Even when there is more than one person on the screen, only the set target follows well.

            <strong>6. Get 3D coordinates of an object when two different camera detect the object.</strong>
            <div class="writing">
                Using cameras to find 3D coordinates of an object in the real world is very important.
                If the 3D coordinate of the object is obtained, the movement path of the object may be tracked, which may be applied to various studies.
                For example, to distinguish between birds and drones, classification is performed using machine learning based on the flight path of birds and drones.
                In this case, how can we obtain the flight path of birds?  
                Surprisingly, only two cameras can tell the bird's 3D flight path. This project is to extract a person's movement path with two cameras.
                The methodology was referenced in the IEEE paper. Code and hardware implementation was done by us.
                Also, We made this research possible even when the camera moves. The paper only suggests the situation that camera cannot moves though.<br><br>

            <strong>7. Conducting several experiments using ZED 2i stereo camera</strong>
            <div class="writing">
                When using various computer vision technologies, a single camera often comes with many limitations. 
                That's why researchers frequently utilize two cameras to overcome these limitations. 
                The hardware that consolidates the essence of these research efforts is the ZED 2i stereo camera. 
                We conducted experiments using this camera to explore its capabilities.
                Especially, the first one is getting position of camera itself based on its real time video. (Not based on GPS). 
                Every experiment is conducted by using Python.

            <strong>8. Implementing Object re-identification algorithm</strong>
            <div class="writing">
                The "Object Reidentification Problem" refers to the task of identifying and tracking objects across different views or frames in a video or image sequence. 
                In computer vision and image processing, this problem is a crucial component of tasks like surveillance, tracking, and scene understanding.
                Imagine you have a video stream from multiple cameras capturing the same scene from different angles. The goal is to correctly associate and match the same object that appears in different camera views. 
                This is challenging because objects can change appearance due to variations in lighting, viewpoint, occlusion, and other factors.
                We Implemeted this algorithm by using Python.

            <div class="writing">
                It is very important to introduce your abilities to others in modern society.
                It's a great way to meet and make a speech, but sometimes it can be a difficult environment to meet.
                Introducing yourself over the web may be one of the best ways.
                We created an undergraduate page web to easily introduce students' projects to others.
                In addition, if you have an idea, you can also develop any kind of app/web.
                If you do an app/web development that helps the lab, the professor may give you an incentive :)
